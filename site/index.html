	<h1>Hello  Coursera!</h1>
	<p>I am now updating a new paragraph as I am looking at my page in the localhost:3000 and typing a paragraph into my html file on sublime.

	</p>

	<h2>hello again</h2>
	<p>I still had to refresh the localhost page when I typed in here.  How come?</p>

	<p>I git it now.  Haha.  I've added on and on and see them appear on the git site file after I complete the steps through the push stage.  I hope I can still read my notes if I ever get a design job.</p>
